# Kubernetes Pods

A Pod was generated by **Kubernetes** to hold the application instance. A Pod acts as an abstraction in **Kubernetes**, signifying a collection of one or more application containers, such as Docker, along with some shared resources for those containers. These resources consist of:

- Shared storage, as Volumes
- Networking, as a unique cluster IP address
- Information about how to run each container, such as the container image version or specific ports to use

A Pod in **Kubernetes** represents a logical host for an application and can contain multiple tightly coupled containers. For example, a Pod may contain a Node.js application container and a container that supplies data to the Node.js webserver. The containers in a Pod share IP addresses and port spaces and run on the same node. When a Deployment is created on **Kubernetes**, it creates Pods with containers inside them instead of creating containers directly. Each Pod is associated with a specific node and remains there until it's terminated or deleted. If a node fails, identical Pods are scheduled on other available nodes in the cluster.

# Nodes

A Pod is always associated with a **_Node_**, which is a worker machine in **Kubernetes**, and can be either virtual or physical. The control plane manages each Node, and a Node can accommodate several pods. The **Kubernetes** control plane schedules the pods across the **_Nodes_** in the cluster, considering the available resources on each Node.

Every Kubernetes Node runs at least:

- Kubelet is a process that manages the Pods and containers running on a machine in Kubernetes. It is responsible for communication between the control plane and the Node.
- A container runtime, such as Docker, is responsible for performing tasks such as pulling a container image from a registry, unpacking the container, and running the application.
