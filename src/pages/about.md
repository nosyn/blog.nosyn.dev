  <p>
    Welcome! My full name is Son Yen Nguyen and
    <span class="font-bold italic">nosyn</span>
    is my name with my last and middle initials writing backward. I'm a proud Vietnamese
    software developer with a passion for coding, hiking, traveling, and spending
    time with my family. I was born and raised in Vietnam, and had the opportunity
    to further my education in the United States, attending Texas A&M University -
    Corpus Christi.

    As a full web stack developer, I have honed my skills in front-end, back-end,
    databases, and cloud technologies. I am currently working as a web developer
    at Plus One Robotics in San Antonio. With my diverse background and a love for
    technology, I'm excited to share my experiences and insights with others in
    the software development community.
